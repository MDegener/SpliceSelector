Description: The SpliceSelector package faclitates a targeted analysis of 
  alternatively spliced candidate exons in any RNAseq dataset. 
  The required input is a list of genomic coordinates (chr:start-end), 
  an exon annotation file (e.g. GENCODE) and the results from common splicing 
  analysis tools. Results from MISO, DEXSeq, leafcutter and MAJIQ will be supported.
