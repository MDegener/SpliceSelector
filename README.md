# SpliceSelector Tool

The SpliceSelector tool takes a list of genomic coordinates (chr:start-end) to select splice events that match to the supplied coordinates.

Currently, only results from [DEXSeq](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html) and [leafcutter](https://github.com/davidaknowles/leafcutter) are supported.
